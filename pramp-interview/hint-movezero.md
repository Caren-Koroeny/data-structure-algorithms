**Move Zeros To End**

Work through an example with only one zero. How do you modify the array, and where?

Work through an example with two zeroes, keeping track of the location of the zeroes.

Where should the left-most nonzero value go? What about the second-left-most nonzero value?

After you place those values (left-most nonzero, second-left-most nonzero), what is the remaining part of the array you need to consider?

If the solution does not implicitly skip groups of zeroes, ask whether your peerâ€™s solution has time complexity linear in the number of array elements, in the case where there are equal numbers of zero and nonzero elements.
